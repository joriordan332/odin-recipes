<h2>Easy Four Cheese Lasagna</h2>
<p>This makes a very authentic tasting lasagna, rich, cheesy and very filling.</p>
<h2>Ingredients</h2>
<ul>
    <li>16 ounces uncooked lasagna noodles</li>
    <li>1 (26 ounce) can spaghetti sauce</li>
    <li>1 pound cottage cheese</li>
    <li>8 ounces shredded mozzarella cheese</li>
    <li>8 ounces shredded Cheddar cheese</li>
    <li>1 cup grated Parmesan cheese</li>
</ul>
<ol>
    <li>Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).</li>
    <li>Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Add pasta and cook for 8 to 10 minutes or until al dente; drain.</li>
    <li>In a blender or with an electric mixer, blend tomato sauce and cottage cheese together until smooth. Spoon a little of the sauce mixture in the bottom of a 9x13 baking dish.
